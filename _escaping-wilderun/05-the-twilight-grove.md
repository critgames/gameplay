> Entrusted with a crustacean, they journeyed into twilight's embrace, only to find the key was within their grasp all along, yet the path ahead remained shrouded in the grove's mysteries.

* **Delving Deeper**: The party progresses further into the Twilight Grove.
* **Crab's Fate**: Returning the crab. Lobster. Thing.
* **Dragon Key Curiosity**: Yay, a key. I mean, we already had it, I already picked it, but yay.
* **Reward and Realization**: They receive the desired key and choose an item (a wooden feather) from an altar, only to discover the chief possessed the actual key.
* **Discussion and Descent**: The party continues down on its pursuit towards the Twilight Grove. It's gotta be down there.
* **Guide's Absence**: Their initial guide is no longer accompanying them, having left with the crab.
* **Forgotten Ally**: The dwarf they had previously freed leaves them, although they had forgotten he was there. He will be missed.

## Episode 5
*The party was tasked to retrieve a stolen crab, leading them into a dungeon and the mention of a mysterious Twilight Grove. They ultimately chose to return the crab to its owner and received a key as a reward, only to realize the chief possessed the actual key they sought. Despite the somewhat unnecessary quest for the key, the party decided to descend further into the Twilight Grove to explore its mysteries.*

#### Hints

<details>
<summary>Hints for decoding!</summary>

1. There are only two one-letter words in the English language, and only one of them appears capitalized other than the beginning of a sentence.
2. For determining a cipher type (e.g., a rotating cipher or more complex ciphers), look for that repeating letter. If it's always the same, it's a plain cipher.
3. (With X as an unknown) the pattern I'X can only be I'm or I'd, unless you add colloquialisms.
4. Words ending in X' are frequently possessives, and X must be the letter S. (E.g., James' house.)
5. Words ending in 'X are almost always 't (the contraction, like wouldn't) or 's (possessive, like Robert's).
6. Two-letter words are tough because there are so many of them. However, with one of the two letters the other letter is a smaller set. E.g., tX is likely "to", Xn is likely "on" or "in".
7. Look for common patterns. E.g., with Z, X, and Y as unknown, XYXZ't matches the word "didn't" and few other words (I can't think of any).

We returned the lobster dude. Or dudette, whatever. And for that, we got... wait for it... a wooden feather. No, I didn’t write that wrong. A *wooden*. *Feather*. All this bother about a bivalve, and all we get is. A. *Wooden*. ***Feather***.

So there’s some major bad stuff going on, someone resurrected us to fix it – and we’re the cream of the crop. The best dead adventurers they could find. They totally didn’t scrape the bottom of the barrel, we’re the best. So when the other guys picked a wooden feather, without knowing what it would do, I’m sure they had a good reason. I mean, it all looked like junk to me, so, sure. There’s got to be something about a feather – I mean, a wooden feather – that is worth it.

I don’t get the whole fascination with money and stuff, but I can use it to get nice stuff. Plus, if it’s that important to everyone else, then I should have as much as I can get. I don’t know what the feather is for, but I’m sure it’s good for something. And it’s party treasure. Because there’s only one feather, and seven of us. Man, there had better be a payoff for this, I’m not used to working for free or whatever random stuff we pick up off the ground.

Oh, wait, there’s more. So then this chief guy, he looks all happy and stuff when he gives us a key he says we need. Nope. That’s the to the door that I already picked and Zero had made a copy of. Thanks. For nothing. Really. Maybe their mortal enemies in the levels down below us will offer me a contract on this “King”? That’d be cool.

Anyway, we moved on, towards the grove that Preacher is so fixated on. Fortunately, nothing we’re finding requires us to think too much – which is good, because I bet they can’t even decipher this, and it’s like the baby cipher we learned in the guild – and the treasure is, like, just okay. But there’s supposedly some big evil thing we were resurrected for, Preacher thinks the grove we’re heading for it. It might not be, and no one is really asking if it is, except me, but I haven’t asked them, because Preacher is completely fixated on it, and sure, I’ll help resolve this before we find out what we’re really here for. I kinda hope we were resurrected for something bigger than an evil tree.

There was a long hallway, and a door behind which there were tons of monsters. Probably the two-headed things, I heard tons of voices. Like, more than 40? I think, there were tons and tons of voices. So we skipped that door and went into the door at the end, where I heard only two voices. It was like ten feet away from the first door, so of course if we fight they’re gonna come out behind us, we’ll be surrounded, and I hope there’s shadows and stuff because no way we’re gonna survive with 40 monsters behind us and whatever in front of us.

Turns out, the monsters in the back room were just being quiet. There was a king thing there, about five or six others, and a big round hole. They attacked, I didn’t even get a chance to find out if they wanted to take out a contract on the other king.

Perplexidor kept tossing the monsters over into it – some of them he’d killed before tossing them, some of them went screaming then suddenly silent with a crunch. Flibbertigibbet actually cast a spell that worked! It would have been cooler if he’d done it again, or hadn’t been so excited that he forgot to do anything useful for the rest of the battle, but hey he helped! In the battle, a few more entered from another door, but not from the guard room that had like 40 of the guys. I don’t know why, Perplexidor alone made enough noise to bring them all crashing out. Zero fought his usual rear-guard action, hiding behind the rest of us, peeking out, and casting illusions. He actually cast a spell that worked, though! A big dragon that looked like it came out of the hole. It frightened some of the monsters away.

So behind that door was a bunch of kids and old people and weak people. I like killing, okay? But not helpless kids. I mean, unless I’m getting paid of course. But Preacher, he goes all fire-mad, kills and slays tons of innocents, burns half the room up. I found a few things, but these were just poor peasants so there wasn’t much there.

While we’re doing that, Flibbertigibbet goes down into the hole. He was there for a while, then came back up. We went down later, and found some skeletons and other stuff, a couple of blights, and the corpses that Flibbertigibbet looted. I dunno if he would have kept it, but he doesn’t have any pockets. And since he has no clothes and no pockets, if he ever pulls money out from somewhere, I’m not touching it.

When we went down we found a couple of skeletons and some blights. We fought them, and the monsters there really liked Perplexidor, that was fun to watch. He kept getting hit. He killed a lot of them, sure, but they just kept picking on him! He didn’t die, so the fun part was watching him get hit. Over, and over, and over.

After that we got into a small hallway with lots and lots of doors. The party, as I should have expected by now, all went in different directions. Each person to a different door. When they all get slaughtered for splitting the party like that? I just don’t wanna join them in the whole dying thing. I did that once, and it was spectacular, and next time I die I want it to be just as much fun, not because we split the party up and ran into rooms all willy-nilly. I wonder how much I’ll miss them when they’re not banging around, hiding behind the other party members, looking confused at what should have been simple logical deductions, yelling, and all the other stuff they do.

The first room had five sleeping guards in it. Or maybe six. I dunno, I lost count after there was blood everywhere. Except my fur, of course, I didn’t get any blood on my fur. I hate it when that happens. Retch and Perplexidor joined me, the monster dudes were sleeping really really deeply. Without a guard. And we gave them the eternal sleep. Well, eternal so long as no one resurrects them, I guess.

The area was like a barracks or something, there was a weapons cache (nothing good), weapons and armor repair areas, a sleeping room (completely splattered in blood), and stuff like that. The dwarf left, seeing his exit and taking it. We shoulda followed him, the underdark might be fun.

We poked through all of that, finally left that area, and then finally reached a room with a dragon statue. Retch went ape of course. His dragon detector didn’t go off, so he knew it wasn’t a real dragon. The grove should be close.

Retch is still looking for some chalice thing. He still hasn’t figured out that when the parchments we found said “we’re resurrecting long dead heroes” that he’s the long dead hero. The chalice is gone, dude. And he claims to not understand money. So he gives it all to me – and expects me to be his accountant. There’s only two kinds of money – mine, which I have, and other people’s, which by definition and deduction, I don’t have. This is an equivalence, you can be assured that the converse is also true. Okay, now that I say that I think there’s three kinds: the third kind is the stuff that’s not mine, but can be made into mine by taking it. And if I get away with it, that’s my money too.

Preacher started yapping about how we shouldn’t kill innocents. After he torched a billion kids and old people. His ethical inconsistency has been noted.

If we’re ever back in a city, I’m going to find a thesaurus to buy for Grandpa. He can read, he’s a mage thing and scholar. I want to get him a book that has smaller words so he can get to his point faster.

Zero is... still so full of himself. He’ll be okay when he realizes he’s not the only one of us. And that he’s not braver than us. And that he’s not the smartest. And he’s cute, but he’s not the cutest. And he’s not the center of the universe.

Perplexidor learns, like he learned not to just open a door when the guy who can detect traps giggles and says “someone else open it”. Pretty sure Retch hasn’t figured that one out. Retch still lurks over my shoulder when I’m picking locks. One of these days I’m gonna miss a trap, I practice dodging just for that, and when it blows up I’m gonna dodge out of the way and it’s gonna be Retch’s face with a poison needle sticking out of it.

So... did they resurrect us because we were heroes? Or just the seven most dysfunctional people they could find? As for me, I know that I really did die. And I’m getting worried that this is my punishment.
