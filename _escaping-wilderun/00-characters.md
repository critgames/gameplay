### Firbolg Druid

Aodhan (a-on) stands an imposing 10 feet tall, his ashen skin reflecting his fiery nature. Ram-like horns curl from his head, and a wild beard frames his smiling face. His tattered, burn-marked robes release the occasional ember, carrying a faint smoky scent. His dark eyes, flecked with glowing embers, radiate both warmth and intensity.

Despite his size, Aodhan moves with quiet grace, careful not to disturb his surroundings. His soot-stained hands leave traces of ash, a reminder of his bond with fire and renewal. Barefoot and modestly dressed, he carries only a burlap bag. He pauses often, observing nature with quiet reverence. Gentle and caring, he becomes a fierce force against corruption, ready to restore balance.
