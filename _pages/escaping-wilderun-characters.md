![image]({{ '/assets/images/escaping-wilderun/s1e0-aodhan.webp' | relative_url }}){: style="float: left; padding: 20px;" width="33%"}
Aodhan (a-on) stands an imposing 10 feet tall, his ashen skin reflecting his fiery nature. Ram-like horns curl from his head, and a wild beard frames his smiling face. His tattered, burn-marked robes release the occasional ember, carrying a faint smoky scent. His dark eyes, flecked with glowing embers, radiate both warmth and intensity.

Despite his size, Aodhan moves with quiet grace, careful not to disturb his surroundings. His soot-stained hands leave traces of ash, a reminder of his bond with fire and renewal. Barefoot and modestly dressed, he carries only a burlap bag. He pauses often, observing nature with quiet reverence. Gentle and caring, he becomes a fierce force against corruption, ready to restore balance.

### Goals
* Find and Investigate other blight threats in the world.
* Learn new magical spells to control how fires spreads and stop fires.
* Find the source source of the dark magic that is corrupting his home and desrtoy it.

## Kingsley (Dragonborn Fighter)
> "Bringing honor to my bloodline."

![image]({{ '/assets/images/escaping-wilderun/s1e0-kingsley.webp' | relative_url }}){: style="float: left; padding: 10px;" width="33%"}
Kingsley the Rex is a towering red Dragonborn with deep crimson scales that shimmer like molten embers under the sunlight. His broad shoulders and muscular frame make for a formidable presence. His red horns sweep back from his skull, framing a face carved with sharp, angular features. His piercing amber eyes burn that makes even seasoned warriors hesitate. Kingsley carries an assortment of martial weapons at the ready ranging from board and sword, to other deadly implements that he wields with deadly expertise.

Kingsley is fiercely proud and unyielding, embodying the relentless power of fire itself. He approaches challenges head-on, never backing down from a fight, and despises cowardice in any form. His warrior’s spirit is fueled by an unyielding sense of honor, though his temper can be as volatile as the flames he breathes. Loyalty is his foundation—once he considers someone an ally, he will stand by them to the death.

### Goals
* Avenge the death of my brother, Hakov, the high son of Vigga
* Slay Eldrgander (Fire Serpent), the anceint red dragon
* Return to my lands with honor and be crowned king


## Mars (Sorcerer Quasit)
> "*Hiss!*"

![image]({{ '/assets/images/escaping-wilderun/s1e0-mars.webp' | relative_url }}){: style="float: left; padding: 10px;" width="33%"}
Mars is an unusually clever quasit with a flair for magic and mischief. Standing just under two feet tall, his dark green, iridescent skin shifts subtly in the light, and his large, expressive yellow eyes constantly gleam with amusement. His bat-like wings, though tattered, shimmer faintly with magic, and his curved horns and ever-present smirk give him the look of a tiny, mischievous magician.

More playful than cruel, Mars lives for clever schemes. He delights in outsmarting others, but anyone who appreciates his talents may find a fiercely loyal—if exasperating—companion. Though he’s quick to vanish when danger looms, he always circles back to ensure his allies survive. Deep down, Mars sees himself as a grand mastermind, but in reality, he’s a scrappy underdog, always looking for the next trick to prove himself. Wherever he goes, chaos, laughter, and a little bit of magic are sure to follow.

### Goals
* It's a secret!

## Wraithfoot (Bugbear Theif)
> "Life is a game of survival, and I will do what it takes to survive in this world."

![image]({{ '/assets/images/escaping-wilderun/s1e0-wraithfoot.webp' | relative_url }}){: style="float: left; padding: 10px;" width="33%"}
Wraithfoot stands at 6'2", lean and wiry, his dark, shaggy fur mottled with gray. His pointed ears twitch at every sound, and though he appears friendly, his sharp yellow eyes sometimes glint with wariness. He wears a dark hooded cloak and well-worn leather armor, blending into the shadows. Pouches at his belt carry lockpicks, throwing knives, and the occasional stolen trinket.

Wraithfoot excels at mimicry, reading social cues and imitating others with ease. Yet beneath this facade lies deep isolation—he struggles with genuine connections, viewing relationships as transactions. Though charming when needed, he often misjudges trust, leading to missteps. Loyal to the guild that took him in, he seeks purpose but remains emotionally distant, treating social interactions as puzzles to solve.

### Goals
* Progress and be an expert in the guild.
* Grow my skills until life and death are at my disposal.
* Get to the point where I can choose when I’m around strangers, and can be alone when I want to.

## Zoro (Human Wizard)
> "Now, I’m not one to brag–though, let's be honest, my exploits speak for themselves"

![image]({{ '/assets/images/escaping-wilderun/s1e0-zoro.webp' | relative_url }}){: style="float: left; padding: 10px;" width="33%"}
Zoro is a man in his early thirties and undeniably handsome. Towering well over six feet tall, he possesses a lean, athletic build with broad shoulders hinting at underlying strength. Zoro moves with a natural, almost feline grace that belies his size. His face is strikingly handsome, defined by sharp cheekbones, a strong jawline, and a perfectly sculpted nose.

His piercing eyes, a deep green with warm brown, are framed by thick, dark lashes and often hold a hint of both intensity and playfulness. His shoulder-length, dark brown hair, thick and slightly wavy, is often styled loosely, falling around his shoulders in a way that accentuates his features. He often carries a slight smirk or a knowing glint in his eyes, suggesting a confident and perhaps mischievous personality.

### Goals
* Further establish  fame and reputation as a legendary battle mage.
* Earn the admiration and respect of compatriorts as a source of inspiration and example of determination and skill.
* Have a good story to tell for his next book.
