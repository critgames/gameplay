### Description

Aodhan (a-on) stands an imposing 10 feet tall, his ashen skin reflecting his fiery nature. Ram-like horns curl from his head, and a wild beard frames his smiling face. His tattered, burn-marked robes release the occasional ember, carrying a faint smoky scent. His dark eyes, flecked with glowing embers, radiate both warmth and intensity.

Despite his size, Aodhan moves with quiet grace, careful not to disturb his surroundings. His soot-stained hands leave traces of ash, a reminder of his bond with fire and renewal. Barefoot and modestly dressed, he carries only a burlap bag. He pauses often, observing nature with quiet reverence. Gentle and caring, he becomes a fierce force against corruption, ready to restore balance.

### Goals
* Find and Investigate other blight threats in the world.
* Learn new magical spells to control how fires spreads and stop fires.
* Find the source source of the dark magic that is corrupting his home and desrtoy it.

### Description
Kingsley (Rex) is a towering red Dragonborn with deep crimson scales that shimmer like molten embers under the sunlight. His broad shoulders and muscular frame make his presence undeniable, while his powerful tail subtly sways with each step. His horns, dark and ridged like charred obsidian, sweep back from his skull, framing a face carved with sharp, angular features. His piercing amber eyes burn with an intensity that makes even seasoned warriors hesitate.

Kingsley is fiercely proud and unyielding, embodying the relentless power of fire itself. He approaches challenges head-on, never backing down from a fight, and despises cowardice in any form. His warrior’s spirit is fueled by an unyielding sense of honor, though his temper can be as volatile as the flames he breathes. Loyalty is his foundation—once he considers someone an ally, he will stand by them to the death.

### Goals
* Avenge the death of my brother, Hakov, the high son of Vigga
* Slay Eldrgander (Fire Serpent), the anceint red dragon
* Return to my lands with honor and be crowned king
