*In Goldenfields, but wishing you were in Waterdeep.*

## Episode 4
Tares Among the Wheat chronicles the party's arrival and the tumultuous events that unfold in the walled village of Golden Fields, culminating in a surprising diplomatic resolution to an invasion. After a three-day journey from Dark Spire, arriving via a cloud giant's tower, the adventurers settled into the local inn, but their peace was short-lived. The village was soon attacked by bugbears and goblins seeking food. The party engaged in fierce combat, demonstrating their unique abilities and combat prowess. Amidst the fighting, a strategic shift occurred as the party pursued diplomacy and negotiation with the invaders, uncovering their motivations for raiding the village. This led to a peaceful resolution, with the villagers offering provisions in exchange for future trade, and hinting at a larger disorder among the giants that initiated the raids.

## A Test of Steel and Honor
> Battle of Golden Fields By Kingsley, the Rex, Dragonborn Fighter of the Drakfjell Tribe
By the Great Fire, what a journey! Three days we rode upon that cloud giant’s tower, Zephus himself, a truly imposing figure. Not often does one ride the clouds, and I, Kingsley, found it a fitting steed for a Dragonborn of my stature. Though I must confess, the strange little Mars, that quasit sorcerer, decided to transform into a pseudo-dragon during this aerial voyage. A sudden apparition, indeed! My instincts, honed in countless battles, screamed danger! So, naturally, I struck. One cannot be too careful with sudden, scaly appearances. Some of the others thought it amusing, but a true fighter acts, not ponders, when faced with the unknown.

Upon descending into this Golden Fields—a rather plain name for a village, if you ask me—we sought respite at the North Furrows End inn. The innkeeper seemed... distressed, after Zoro's peculiar way of delivering news of his dead parents. Wraithfoot, that cunning bugbear, managed to soften the blow and secure us rooms for free. Not that I needed one; the ground, a true warrior's bed, suits me fine, and I took my watch outside, my scales glistening under the twin moons.

But true peace is fleeting for those destined for glory! A loud, clumsy shout from a halfling named Orin shattered the night. Invaders! Bugbears and goblins, scurrying like rats, breaking into homes for food. This was no mere squabble; this was a challenge! My blood, as red as my scales, stirred for battle.

The fight was glorious! The air crackled with magic and the clang of steel. Wraithfoot, nimble as ever, struck first, an arrow piercing a yellow bugbear. Aodhan, the towering firbolg, even managed to rouse an awakened tree to join our ranks, a formidable ally indeed, its lumbering steps shaking the very ground. Eryndor, despite his troubled soul, brought the chill of sleep to some of the scurrying goblins before charging into the thick of it. And Zoro, ever the showman, tried to sing a tune, transforming into a half-halfling. A peculiar sight, but one that certainly diverted attention.

I, Kingsley, wasted no time. My Rapier, a true extension of my will, flashed through the night. A halfling, the very one who raised the alarm, stumbled. Honor demanded I protect the innocent! I charged, engaging the monstrous bugbears, my every swing aimed to bring swift, decisive end to their advance. They were weak, these creatures, but numerous, and I relish the challenge of overwhelming odds. Mars, the pseudo-dragon, zipped through the air, casting his strange hexes, and even the mage, Maxine, unleashed a blinding bolt of lightning, incinerating their kind. A true display of teamwork, though I did most of the work.

But then, Aodhan, in his strange wisdom, chose to talk to a hill giant. Talk! When steel and fire were the obvious answer! Yet, a true leader observes. We followed tracks, leading us away from the immediate chaos, towards the very source of this invasion. Wraithfoot, with words I barely understood, managed to persuade a bugbear, a leader among these lesser creatures, to cease hostilities and guide us to their Abbott, offering the promise of food. A strange twist, for sure.

We learned these raids were for a gluttonous matriarch, a hill giant queen who gorged herself to grow ever larger, seeking to dominate her kind. A despicable ambition, powered by the suffering of others. The Abbott, an elderly elf, though wary, agreed to our terms: two carts of ill-kept food in exchange for future peace, and a demand for proper trade at the gates from now on. It seems the "ordining" among giants, their very hierarchy, has been shattered, leading to this chaos. A greater threat perhaps, beyond these petty raids.

We saw their numbers: thirty goblins, four giants, six ogres, some armed with crude catapults. A force that could have overwhelmed this village, yet we, through unexpected diplomacy, averted further bloodshed. Wraithfoot even managed to glean information about their entry point, a weakness in the village walls, which I intend to remedy.
This day was a testament to both my strength and the unexpected turns of fate. I, Kingsley, am here to bring honor to my bloodline, to avenge my brother Hakov, and to claim my throne by slaying the ancient red dragon, Eldrgander. These creatures, though lesser, served as a mere stepping stone on my path to true glory. And if dealing with bickering giants leads me closer to my destined foe, then so be it. For a king must lead, even when it means negotiating with those who deserve only the bite of his blade.
