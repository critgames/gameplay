### Ambush & Explosion

> Then the arrows came.

Brigands emerged from the forest, loosing volleys from the shadows. Steel rang. Alchemical fire hissed. The party fought back, forcing their attackers into retreat — until the earth itself tore open.

A violent explosion ripped through the trees. Fire bloomed. Stone and timber were hurled skyward. And from the heart of the blast, screaming brigands twisted and reshaped into horrific, mutilated creatures, fueled by something far worse than mortal rage.

> The party stood their ground and destroyed them.

### Aftermath & Clues

In the smoking crater, Krivek discovered that the explosion had ripped open a deep pit in the forest floor. 

Trees and branches burned, but mixed into the rubble, Krivek could make out reinforced beams and trusses. The ground surrounding the blast was also laced with a strange glittering residue. He carefully collected a sample.

Among the dead they found several clues: a metal badge marked with a “G.”, and a note signed by “A” instructing them to leave the goods at the usual dropoff point.

That night, they slept uneasily beside the standing stones, on the lookout for further attacks.

### Arrival at Grimfield

By morning, the forest finally gave way to Grimfield.They passed the alchemist’s shop, the bakery, and finally reached the bustling main square.

### MidSum Festival

The town burst with life. MidSum Festival banners fluttered from rooftops. Music and laughter filled the streets. Merchants hawked everything from fresh bread and rich fabrics to exotic trinkets — and more than a few suspiciously cheap “authentic” SparkyShards.
 
### At the Inn

The party took rooms at the inn, where ale flowed freely and the air buzzed with excitement. Sylvar took to the stage, turning charm and an impressive archery display into a tidy profit. The rest of the party watched the crowd, nursing drinks and fending off a would-be pickpocket bold enough to try his luck.

### Notable Figures

At one table sat three wizards, cloaked in ego and ambition:
> Caldrin Vellor (Sorceror of the Seventh Ring of Ephezious, Master of Flux, Foresight, and Fortunate Outcomes), Edrick Thorne (High Magister of the Seventh and Half Circle, Warden of Preparatory Mysteries, and Bearer of the Unbroken Sigil.), and a man who simply called himself Pete. Professor Rogen Lumentide spoke with them about SparkShards and their origins, but it was clear they were here not for knowledge — but for power.

### Temptation

In a brief moment of insanity, Fen suggested that they should simply open the chest and take the gold for themselves. Chickory, clearly a goody-two-shoes, was immensely offended at the mere suggestion that he might be persuaded to abscond with the treasure – and sternly reminded Fen that “Lawful Neutral” actually meant something. After consulting some manuals and the great Web of knowledge, Fen concurred and dropped the matter.

### Chickory Investigates

Uneasy, Chickory left the warmth of the tavern and made his way to the town garrison, intent on learning how well this auction was truly protected.
