## Summary
The village of Grimfield is buzzing with excitement as MidSum festivities begin and word spreads of a dazzling Spark Shard up for auction—said to be the largest ever found. Sent to purchase this rare magical treasure, you arrive to find a once-quiet town overflowing with merchants, mages, games, rumors, and a festival brimming with opportunity. Yet beneath the revelry, you can’t shake the feeling that something is...off.

### Overview
Grimfield, my friend, is no ordinary hamlet. Tucked away near the whimsically named Blue Mountains, it's the kind of place that's not so much a destination as a polite suggestion on a map—a pit stop for the curious, the hungry, and the adventurer who forgot trail rations again. No dragons circling its skies, no trolls charging bridge tolls. In fact, Grimfield is about as fantastical as a turnip.

That is, until Sir Magnus arrived. A year ago, the flamboyant merchant marched into Grimfield, cloak fluttering, and proclaimed to anyone who would listen: “Spark Shards, my good people! Magical crystals to elevate your spells and—ah—fatten my… no, wait—your coin purses!” Some shards flickered like cantrips. Others thrummed with serious arcane potential. A few were so unpredictable they were immediately labeled “absolutely do not lick.” But one thing was certain: the larger the shard, the rarer and more coveted it became. And with that, the once-forgettable village transformed into a bustling destination for wandering mages, eager adventurers, opportunistic merchants, and the occasional charlatan peddling “100% genuine shards” the size of marbles.

Your arrival could not be better timed. Grimfield is currently celebrating MidSum, its most extravagant festival, and the town is overflowing with traveling merchants, performers, scholars, hustlers, hedge-wizards, and questionable entrepreneurs all hoping to buy—or swindle someone out of—a Spark Shard. Colorful tents crowd the village square, sparkshard lanterns glow with uneven enthusiasm, and the tavern swears its ale only catches fire “on rare occasions.” The real attraction, however, is the MidSum Auction, where Sir Magnus is set to unveil a Major Spark Shard, a crystal of immense power and staggering value.

And that’s where you come in. The esteemed Archmage Finnian Silverthorn has entrusted you with a magically sealed chest containing 20,000 gold pieces and a simple directive: win the shard. With your packs full and spirits high, you set off through Greenleaf Forest toward a sleepy village turned arcane marketplace—unaware that your “simple errand” is about to become spectacularly complicated, and not just by the people trying to outbid you.
