*In a gritty cyberpunk dystopia, a biocorporation's sinister plot to control the future of tech leads to a devastating apocalypse.*

## Summary
XinSheng Biotechnologies, a Chinese Biotech megacorporation that grows organs for transplants, hires The Viridian Veil, an anti-tech terrorist group, to scare people away from cybernetic implants. These luddites are anti-tech fanatics that start ripping out cybernetic enhancements from peopleâ€™s bodies (killing them) while hypocritically reselling those parts on the black market to inevitably be reused. Ironically, their goal is anti-tech which aligns with the biotech megacorp goals to discourage cybertech in favor of biotech.
