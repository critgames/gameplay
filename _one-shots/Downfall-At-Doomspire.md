Welcome to Doomspire, a dark citadel set within the active volcano Mount Doom! In this one-shot, players are a motley crew of villains and fiends serving the Lord of Darkness.

Darkspire Citadel rises within the volcanic heart of Mount Doom, an imposing fortress carved directly from obsidian and jagged basalt. Its spires twist unnaturally, clawing upward as if to pierce the ash-choked sky. Rivers of molten lava cascade through channels carved into the rock, glowing veins of fiery light that illuminate the citadelâ€™s menacing silhouette.

At its heart lies the throne room known as the Court of Darkness, where the Lord of Darkness resides, his throne perched atop a dais surrounded by a bubbling moat of magma. These are the final hours of an epic clash between darkness and the forces of light!
