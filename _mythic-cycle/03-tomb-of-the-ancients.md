## Episode 3
> After the adventurers are stranded in the deep desert after a sandstorm swallows their caravan. Hope seems lost until they spot a half-buried pyramid jutting from the dunes. The ruins are by rival cults clinging to the memory of forgotten gods. At the heart lies a monstrous guardianâ€”a god-serpent born of ancient blasphemy. To survive, the players must navigate faction politics, uncover ancient secrets, and prepare for the awakening of the Blood of Lothan.
