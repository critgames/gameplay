## Episode 5
> Evil never dies. Never sleeps. Never satiates. Ever listful.
> It festers in the quiet places where the light doesn’t reach—beneath crypt stones slick with old blood, in the whispers of dying men, in the hollow prayers of those who have given up hope.
> She stirs once more, pale and merciless, her will moving through the world like a sickness. She does not stride the mortal realm herself; she doesn’t need to. Her touch is carried by her servants—the Death Eaters.
> They are not a mere cult. They are carrion in human form–teeth are blackened from the feast of flesh; their robes stink of grave dirt and rot. They do not worship death—they serve it, feed it, spread it like wildfire through the bones of kingdoms. Their rites are crude and terrible.
> In the shadows of the growing war between Balek and Mot, they move unseen. Conflict is their harvest, and the dead are their tithe. Wherever men kill men, the Death Eaters follow, dragging bodies from the mud to the altar.
> Now, their mistress has given them purpose. Vengeance. Adventurers who once defied her are marked for death. One by one, they will vanish, their names swallowed by silence, their bones offered up in the old ways.
> Her servants feed while the world rots.
> Evil never dies—it only hungers.

* **Prologue: The Death Eaters' Purpose**: The prologue established the theme that "evil never dies" and that a "pale and merciless mistress" (the White Lady/Red Lady) is stirring and seeking vengeance against adventurers who once defied her. Her servants, the Death Eaters, are shades from the underworld of Shol looking to rot vengeance upon the living.
* **Assigning the Shades**: Participants selected cards to determine their Death Eater shade identities, based on seven deadly sins. The five shades assigned were: Pride (the exalted shade), Envy (the covetous shade), Greed (the gilded ma), Lust (the scarlet temptress), and Gluttony (the ma eternal).
* **The Aboleth's Command to Vengeance**: An ancient watcher, an abalith, used its consciousness to slide between worlds and assist the White Lady in tracking down the "changeling betrayer," Raz Malstrom, who had lost his warlock abilities. The White Lady ordered the shades to be sent to the upper worlds to "slay Raz Malstrom".
* **Unleashing the Shades via Bloodrite**: The necromancer, "Frogs Delight Bone Rattler," sought out the shades' graves in an ancient graveyard, aided by goblins. The shades were identified using riddles related to their sins, such as Greed locking himself in his vault and Lust chasing every desire. The shades were resurrected using specific items: a golden bracelet for Envy, a senet ring for Greed, and a flipbook of goblinetses for Lust. The final step was a bloodrite where the necromancer sacrificed all the goblin companions to open the mausoleum and unleash the shades from Shol into the material world.
* **First Target: Raz Malstrom (Warlock/Sorcerer**): The shades tracked Raz Malstrom, who was disguised as "Gio," a double-timing dwarf, to a lonely, run-down tavern where he was drinking. Pride entered the tavern but, believing Raz was not there, left. Gluttony bit the furniture in excitement, rousing Raz from his drunken stupor. Lust charmed a barmaid who pointed out Raz. Lust then delivered the final, fatal "piercer kiss," which dealt a massive 40 damage, causing Raz's changeling form to cycle through all his past visages before he collapsed and reverted to his true form.
* **Second Target Eros (Cleric)**: The shades easily tracked Eros, a Shadar Kai who had lost his clerical abilities when the Raven Queen died, to a quiet funeral house and shrine at the edge of civilization. Pride's radiant blade multiattack and Envy's multi-claw strike sliced across Eros's body, killing him quickly. Gluttony immediately consumed Eros.
* **Third Target Marius (Monk)**: Marius was found at the docks, playing a game of Bones with several pirates/slavers. Greed successfully used the Mine All Mine ability to steal the gold pot. Marius sliced off Greed's hand. Gluttony attacked and killed the remaining slavers. Pride delivered the final, fatal blow to Marius. Marius's last words were, "At least the slavers are dead".
* **Fourth Target: Honk (Goliath Warrior)**: Honk, the renowned Goliath warrior, was found severely wounded on a battlefield, covered in his own blood. The shades pummeled Honk with Lust's piercer kiss and Gluttony's engulf and digest. Greed successfully stole Honk's Vasodilator. Honk died laughing, succumbing to his wounds after saying, "At least it wasn't boring" and "See you on the other side Kesh".
* **The Heroes' Vengeance**: Kesh, Honk's best friend (now running a fruit smoothie restaurant), saw Honk's last moments using a scrying coin that Honk carried. Kesh linked up with the remaining heroes: Whisper, who had become an admiral of a bone ship (The Argentell) with an undead crew, and Quinton, who was now a renowned bard.
* **The Shades' Sea Voyage**: The shades stole a ship called the Floatsum Gently and began a boring voyage across the frigid North Sea toward the Maracant lands. During the voyage, Lust unsuccessfully attempted to kiss Gluttony, and Pride fell overboard while demonstrating his hovering ability.
* **The Final Confrontation at Sea**: The shades' ship became stuck in an unnerving dead calm. The heroes' bone ship, the Argentell, glided through the water and intercepted the shades' vessel.
* **Death of Quinton (Bard)**: Quinton initiated combat by casting Shatter, damaging the shades and the ship. Lust flew to the crow's nest where Quinton was positioned. Lust kissed him, delivering 56 damage (massive overkill). Quinton died, turning into a pile of goo.
* **Death of Whisper (Admiral/Necromancer)**: Pride closed the gap and used Crown of Supremacy, centering the highly damaging attack on Whisper. Whisper failed the saving throw, taking 47 radiant damage, which was lethal. Whisper smiled, embraced her death, and faded away, causing her entire undead crew (including the Dracalich and the skeletons) to collapse.
* **Death of Lust and Envy**: Kesh, flying 100 feet above the combat area, began sniping the remaining shades using Eldritch Blast and Lightning Bolt. Kesh hit Lust with a Lightning Bolt, dealing enough damage to turn Lust into a "fully dysfunctional corpse". Envy, attempting to board the boat from the water, was struck by an Eldritch Blast and disintegrated.
* **Final Duel (Kesh versus Pride & Gluttony)**: Gluttony and Pride (who was now severely damaged) retreated below deck to hide, planning to wait out Kesh's Fly spell which had limited duration. Kesh sealed the entrances to the below-deck area with a Wall of Fire. Pride eventually broke cover and escaped the burning deck. Kesh continued to snipe Pride from afar. The session ended on a cliffhanger, with Kesh having only a few turns of flight left, engaged in a tense standoff with the two hidden/evading shades.

# Act I: Sheol
> We are between worlds—somewhere between the material world and the underworld.
> Sheol—a place of shades and shadows. A place of grey.
> All must pass through here and very few stay—unless…unless they don’t belong to either world. Caught between the material plane, but not confident to descend into the underworld.
> This is the shadowland—the deadland, a barred pit, a place of despair…and darkness.

Before the true darkness of the tale commenced, the minds of the adventurers spun with shared, chaotic invention. In one instance, they were desperately clinging to a spaceship hurtling through an asteroid field, attempting to change the oil, only to drop the crucial wrench into a colossal vat of M&M's. In the next, a frantic, fluffy chaos broke out: an urgent quest to hide a giant sparkly egg while avoiding the massive teeth of seven-foot-tall, transforming penguins—all because someone had fed them after midnight. These fantastical, high-stakes improvisations served merely as the prelude to the terror that was to come.

## The White Lady
A grim truth hung over the dark corners of the realms: "Evil never dies, never sleeps, never satiates". In the quiet, lightless places, "beneath the crypt stones slick with old blood," she stirred once more. She was the mistress, "pale and merciless," and her will moved through the world "like a sickness". She required no mortal stride, for her touch was carried by her chosen servants, the Death Eaters.
These Death Eaters were shades drawn from the underworld of Shol, a realm defined as a shadowland and "dead land". Shol was a place "between worlds," comprised of gray, a "barred pit, a place of despair and darkness" where few remained unless they were "caught between the material plane and the underworld and not confident enough to descend". These shades sought a path into the world to enact their mistress’s "vengeful rule".
The chosen legion of vengeance was five strong, each embodiment of a fatal flaw, their purpose now focused by this renewed hunger:
* **Pride, the Exalted Shade**: Surrounded by a brilliant aura that radiated superiority, Pride's very presence challenged the courage of any foe, forcing them to confront their own hubris made flesh. His ability sheets detailed his radiant blade and inherent sense of supremacy.
* **Envy, the Covetous Shade**: This shade studied every move, perpetually coveting the strengths of its targets and twisting them into weaknesses. It held the horrifying power to copy a target’s highest attack ability and assume the appearance of creatures it had seen through its Stolen Shadow and Jealous Form.
* **Greed, the Gilded Shade**: An insatiable collector, golden light glinted from its claws and teeth. Its inherent hunger was weaponized by the ability Mine All Mine, which allowed it to instantly teleport any dropped object within thirty feet into its hands.
* **Lust, the Scarlet Temptress**: Every glance was a snare, every movement a lure. Desire was its weapon, allowing it to manipulate both body and mind. Her devastating piercer kiss drained vitality, and her Siren's Dance allowed for deceptive illusion and escape.
* **Gluttony, the Eternal Maw**: An endless, ravenous hunger defined this shade. It did not merely fight; it consumed. Its Engulf and Digest attack allowed it to swallow foes whole, and its Feast Unending ensured that every creature death within fifteen feet restored Gluttony’s own strength.
The Command to Slay Raz Malstrom
Deep in the fathomless dark, where no light dared to tread, the Ancient Watcher—an Aboleth, a "psychic leviathan"—bent its vast, cold intellect to the mistress's will. Its consciousness could "slide between the worlds" to help the White Lady track her targets.
The Aboleth focused on the missing warlock, the "changeling betrayer":

> Aboleth: "i found him as you've asked... he's washed up, he's a drunk, he's at a tavern".
> White Lady: "well he should be easy prey then".
> Aboleth: "he was once my thrall but no longer I have taken my abilities from him".

The pale mistress delivered her decree of retribution: "we shall kill him," but his end must be agonizing and slow. She ordered the shades to be sent to the "upper worlds" with a single purpose: "slay Raz Malstrom, let's release them now we shall".
The necromancer Frogs Delight Bone Rattler, along with his goblin companions, then conducted a bloodrite in an ancient graveyard to open the mausoleum gate from Shol. The necromancer resurrected the shades by identifying their graves using riddles and placing an object related to their deadly sin upon the tomb—a golden bracelet for Envy, a senet ring for Greed, and a flipbook of goblinetses for Lust. Finally, the necromancer sacrificed all his goblin friends in a bloodrite across the mausoleum doors, unleashing the Death Eaters into the material world.
