## Episode 1
The "Fallen Warlord" is the inaugural episode of a campaign set within a world shaped by an endlessly turning mythic cycle, where gods actively intervene in the lives of mortals. Players assume the roles of "zero-level adventurers" within the Ardenne army, a dominant military power. This initial adventure serves as an introduction to a world fraught with magic, monsters, and a constant struggle between order and chaos, creation and destruction. The core concept involves one of these seemingly expendable zero-level characters rising through the ranks to become a significant leader, and eventually, a central antagonist or "butcher king" within the Ardenne military. The episode introduces the Warring Ardenese, behemoths (giant primordial monsters), large army tactics, and the beginnings and rise of a new Ardene Warlord, while also hinting at the return of the Morningstar.

* **The Mythic Cycle Turns**: The adventure begins with an introduction to a world governed by an endlessly turning mythic cycle, where gods like Balek (aligned with Maercant) and Mot (aligned with Ardenne) are engaged in a "divine gambit" with human lives.
* **Jungle Infiltration**: Zero-level Ardenne soldiers, including the player characters, are sent deep into a jungle by their Warlord, Hrothgar, tasked with recovering the young of a Behemoth, specifically its eggs.
* **Brutal Combat and Warlord's Death**: The mission quickly devolves into "mortal combat," introducing new, brutal dying mechanics. During this fight, the Warlord Hrothgar is killed.
* **Honoring the Fallen**: The surviving soldiers are tasked with honoring the Warlord and carrying his body back to camp. This involves a "hexcrawl/survival" minigame, as they are chased by a Behemoth.
* **Return to Camp and Eulogy**: The group returns to a bustling, disciplined Ardenne camp, where a eulogy is given for the fallen Warlord, Hrothgar.
* **A New Leader Rises**: To cover up Hrothgar's death, one of the zero-level characters, specifically the one who brought back the Behemoth egg(s), is made the new Warlord/lieutenant by the council. This character is Iron Helm, known for charisma and the ability to command men and beasts.
* **Passage of Time and Conquest**: Several years pass, during which the Behemoth eggs hatch and become pets/sidekicks to the new Warlord. The new Warlord, Iron Helm, begins a campaign of dominance, amassing troops, capturing territory, building strongholds, and modernizing the army.
* **Emerging Threats**: The episode concludes with the war raging between the Ardenne and the Maercant, the Morningstar (a ship) being prepared for battle, and hints of the Death Eaters/Void Seekers cult and their philosophy of cleansing and purifying humanity. The morally ambiguous choices made by the player-chosen Warlord lead to them becoming the "butcher king".

## Prologue: The Turning Wheel
The world, a vibrant tapestry woven from magic and ancient strife, teetered on the precipice of a new age, its mythic cycle turning once more. For millennia, gods had played their divine gambits, their colossal wills shaping the destinies of mortals. Balek, the enigmatic patron of the mercantile Maercant, pitted his might against Mot, the fierce deity championing the militaristic Ardenne. Their celestial war, a dance of creation and destruction, bled into the mortal realms, unleashing terrifying consequences upon humanity. Yet, even in the face of such overwhelming fate, a nascent hope flickered – in the hearts of those who dared to defy the predetermined course, to chart their own path through the storm. This was the dawn of a new saga, and its first chapter began not with kings or legendary heroes, but with the lowest ranks of the Ardenne army.

## Act I: The Behemoth
### The Jungle's Maw
The jungle swallowed them whole, a twisted lattice of green blotting out the sun. Shafts of light pierced through in broken fragments, illuminating swarms of insects that drifted like glittering motes in the thick, oppressive air. Each step sank into damp soil, the scent of wet moss and decaying vegetation clinging to their lungs. This was the Southern part of the continent, far from the disciplined ranks and bustling camps of the Ardenne. Here, the thin line of zero-level soldiers, barely trained and utterly expendable, marched under the stern gaze of Warlord Hrothgar.
Hrothgar, a figure carved from the very stone of the mountains, strode ahead, his broad shoulders cloaked in wolfskin, the beast’s fangs framing his weathered face. A jagged scar, proudly borne, ran from brow to cheek. His hands, gnarled and powerful, gripped a great axe, its iron head dark with the patina of countless battles. His voice, deep and steady like the sea before a storm, had thundered their impossible orders: "Recover the young of a Behemoth. Its egg.". A fool's errand, perhaps, yet they pressed on, each step a testament to Ardenne obedience, or perhaps, desperation.

### Hrothgar's Fall
The combat erupted without warning, a maelstrom of claws, teeth, and raw, primordial fury. A hulking Behemoth, its massive form a shuddering force of chaos, lunged from the dense foliage, tearing through their unprepared ranks. The air filled with the screams of the dying, the brutal new mechanics of this battlefield asserting themselves with swift, unforgiving finality. Amidst the chaos, a poisoned arrow, launched from an unseen foe, found its mark. Warlord Hrothgar, the seemingly indomitable chieftain, stumbled, an arrow piercing his eye. He fell, a silent testament to the jungle's merciless grip, his life extinguishing as quickly as it had ignited.

Panic threatened to unravel the remaining survivors. One, a stoic warrior named Ragna, found herself clutching a Behemoth egg, its smooth, cool surface a stark contrast to the bloody carnage around her. Another, Iron Helm, his usual thunderous voice now a desperate roar, rallied the shattered remnants of their squad. The jungle, however, was not done with them. A second Behemoth, sensing vulnerability, closed in, turning their desperate retreat into a frantic hexcrawl for survival. Some, like Barty, succumbed to hallucinogenic effects, their minds twisted by the jungle's strange flora, their actions erratic and unpredictable. They carried Hrothgar’s limp body on a shield, a solemn promise to bring their fallen leader home, even as they navigated a world that seemed determined to swallow them whole.

## Act II: The Fallen Warlord
### Return to the Camp
The Ardenne encampment, when they finally reached it, was a bustling, disciplined affair, a stark contrast to the chaotic jungle they had barely escaped. Leather tents and crude wooden structures huddled around a central fire, the air thick with the smell of woodsmoke, roasting meat, and unwashed bodies. Soldiers, clad in furs and leather, moved with grim purpose, their actions a reflection of the Ardenne's fierce reputation. The rhythmic clang of hammers from a nearby forge and the guttural shouts of officers pierced the constant hum of conversation. Banners, bearing the warlord's stylized raven sigil, flapped in the wind.

As Ragna and Iron Helm bore Hrothgar’s body on a shield through the camp, a somber war drum began to thump, echoing across the village – a summons, an ushering of a fallen warrior. Branches and flowers were thrown towards them, a final tribute to the "wolf cloaked king" as he rode his "final voyage". Hrothgar was laid to rest, his broken spine a silent witness to the brutal truth of their world. Yet, none in the camp questioned how he fell; most had been hallucinating anyway, or were too preoccupied with their duties.

### The Butcher King's Coronation
With the Warlord fallen, a new leader was demanded. Ragna, still clutching the miraculous Behemoth egg(s) she had retrieved, stepped forward. "I believe you have received a field promotion," a voice declared, and the Ardenne soldiers, after a moment of uncertainty, slowly pledged their allegiance. Iron Helm, with his commanding presence and reputation for charisma, had already garnered significant support amongst the Ardenne, even before their ill-fated mission. He was chosen, or perhaps he chose himself, becoming the new Warlord, the "butcher king" of the Ardenne. His very description – tall, with a voice like thunder, and men and beasts obeying his commands without hesitation – cemented his new role. The act of bringing back the Behemoth egg was seen as a sign, a prophecy fulfilled. The campaign, a series of episodic level-ups and unfolding plots, had begun.

## Act III: The Shadow of Conquest
### The Serpent's Brood
Years passed, stretching into a new epoch of Ardenne dominance. The small Behemoth eggs, symbols of Iron Helm’s improbable ascent, hatched under his watchful eye, growing into monstrous yet loyal companions that became his fierce pets and sidekicks. Under his iron will, the Ardenne gathered strength on the southern half of the continent. Iron Helm, now a hardened warlord, subjugated other kingdoms, his armies sweeping across the land in a "bloody campaign of dominance". Strongholds rose from conquered territories, a testament to his ambition. He modernized his army, implementing new tactics and making difficult leadership decisions, balancing social encounters within his camp with the relentless march of conquest.

### The Morningstar's Awakening
But even as the Ardenne empire expanded, shadows gathered. The Maercant, the burgeoning cosmopolitan commonwealth, grew in naval power, their trading routes extensive, and their influence steadily encroaching. Across the high seas, Privateers based in the Western Isles cast a menacing shadow, transforming tranquil waters into a perilous gauntlet. Amidst this escalating tension, a vessel of ominous power began to stir in Maercant territory. Its timbers were dark and strong, its deck bristling with cannons. Docans worked quickly around it, eyes averted, as though the ship itself possessed a consciousness. Carved into its stern, in newly painted letters, lay its name: The Morningstar. It was not merely mourned, but waiting, a beast at rest.

The war between the Ardenne and the Maercant raged, its fate intertwined with the choices of the "butcher king," Iron Helm. The ancient prophecies of the Death Eaters, a cult of Void Seekers who sought to cleanse and purify humanity, began to unfold, their symbol – a crescent moon cradling a lotus – appearing in unexpected places. The world braced itself for a deeper conflict, one that threatened to awaken an Ancient One from the depths of the earth, an entity angered by the killing of titans, capable of opening giant sinkholes and ocean vortexes, and seeking to revert the cosmos to darkness and void. The cycle, indeed, had turned. And Iron Helm, the zero-level soldier who had become a warlord, was now irrevocably bound to its bloody, inevitable path. The story, once a simple quest for an egg, had blossomed into an epic of power, betrayal, and the shaping of a new, brutal age.
