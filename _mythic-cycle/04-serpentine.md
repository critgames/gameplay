## Episode 4
> The pyramid's heart beats with venomous devotion. Deep within the Tomb of the Ancients, rival cults cling to forgotten gods.  At the heart of the pyramid  lies a monstrous guardianâ€”a god-serpent born of ancient blasphemy. To survive, the players must navigate faction politics, uncover ancient secrets, and confront the Spawn of Lotan in order to release the "living waters".
