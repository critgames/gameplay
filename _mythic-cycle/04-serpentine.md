## Episode 4
> The pyramid's heart beats with venomous devotion. Deep within the Tomb of the Ancients, rival cults cling to forgotten gods.  At the heart of the pyramid  lies a monstrous guardian—a god-serpent born of ancient blasphemy. To survive, the players must navigate faction politics, uncover ancient secrets, and confront the Spawn of Lotan in order to release the "living waters".

* **Dining with Serpents**: The session begins as the heroes prepare to dine with the serpent cult, and Vasha motions them to sit on the floor. Simbiscuit, a companion who had befriended the chefs, serves the appetizers of crushed centipede pâté.
* **Activating the Second Statue**: While the party was seating, Ralph secretly poured diluted lotus water into a snake statue's bowl in the hallway, causing its lapis lazuli eyes to glow, confirming its activation. The first course served by Simbiscuit was found to be a terrible stew of rat or vermin.
* **Realizing Imprisonment**: Serpent cult members began positioning themselves, wielding *Khopeshes* (swords with a curved hook) and flanking the doorways. The party learned through snippets of conversation that the cult was cautious, believing the heroes were sent by the priestesses to trick them, and were instructed to keep the party contained.
* **Coordination and Bridge Manipulation**: W00t used Mind Speak to coordinate with Simbiscuit, instructing him to take a flask of lotus water to the final statue. W00t snuck out and manipulated a lever to rotate the canal bridge north/south, allowing Simbiscuit to cross and activate the statue.
* **Escalation with Urine**: When Vasha's guards blocked Court's attempt to leave, Ralph (a Goliath Paladin) stood up and urinated directly on one of the guards in an act of powerful intimidation, causing the guard to flee to the kitchen.
* **Vasha's Ultimatum and Combat Start**: Vasha became furious over the insult, demanded they surrender their weapons, and threatened to kill the priestesses if they refused. Bang shot Vasha in the face with his blunderbuss, initiating combat, and flipped the dining table for cover.
* **Clearing the Serpent Cult**: The party rapidly eliminated the cult members: Bang downed Vasha, Court used Divine Smite, and W00t used a sneak attack to eliminate another enemy, causing the remaining chefs to flee.
* **The Snake Abomination**: After the final statue was activated using the lotus water, a low groan echoed through the pyramid, and a monstrous entity—a sickening mass of dozens of fused, writhing serpents—erupted from the revolving room floor. Ralph ran to the canal switch and rotated the lever, severing the snake abomination and causing it to break apart into tiny pieces. This action revealed a staircase descending below.
* **Long Rest and Descent**: The party decided to ascend to the first floor to take a full eight-hour long rest, restoring their health and spells, as it was a safe location near the priestesses. They then descended the newly revealed staircase into a vast chamber scattered with piles of bleached skulls.
* **Undead Corpse**: They found a desiccated corpse that lurched up and attacked Court. The party dismembered the undead creature (ripping off both arms and cleaving off one leg), realizing it required burning for full destruction, and left it prone.
* **Queen’s Journey Puzzle**: The party entered a chamber that with a door and six tablets. The room began to be flooded after touching broken tablets. They solved the puzzle by correctly arranging six carved panels illustrating the Queen’s life cycle (Birth, Coronation, Ruling, War, Death, Afterlife), which drained the room and opened the tomb.
* **Sarcophagus and Hidden Room**: The next room contained a large sarcophagus carved with the visage of the lion-headed deity Sekhmet (the powerful one, known for destruction). By pulling on the loop (scepter accessory) of a Sekhmet statue, a hidden wall opened.
* **Treasure Room**: The hidden room was a desecrated treasure room. W00t found a small golden scarab (a magic item that boosts artificer abilities), and Bang found an ordinary bottle containing invisible liquid, which turned out to be a contact-based invisibility potion.
* **Undead Cobras**: Entering the chamber to the east showed much older stone and masonry. The party discovered and opened rotten baskets, accidentally triggering a trap and releasing two undead cobras. Cort pinned one cobra to the wall with a javelin, Ralph held one down with a Khopesh, and Court used Divine Smite to destroy it.
* **Discovery of the Water Source**: While viewing murals, the party noticed a large section of the wall was wet. The water compass urn confirmed that the water source was coming from this wall, which investigation revealed was a bricked-up doorway made of older masonry. Through a collective strength effort, the party broke down the bricked-up wall. A humid, petrichor-scented air rushed out, revealing a dark, dusty passage beyond, ending the session on a cliffhanger.
